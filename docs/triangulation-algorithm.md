I do not like the licensing of Fade25D as it restricts the amount of triangles for the standard student license without asking for extra permissions, but it's a full package and may make my life easier if I get a license

TIN-Terrain is limited and doesn't allow constrained DT, but is completely open source.

CGAI looks promising. Open source for scientific use.
