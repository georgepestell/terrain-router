# Route Planners

Modern routing planner applications are used ubiquitously. The vast majority of these focus on car-travel on roads, or limit pedestrian users to pre-defined paths and pavements. The vast majority rank routes based primarily on the shortest path between two points using the network of paths and roads. Few effectively consider the terrain and topography when ranking routes.

There are examples of routing planners which provide elevation data. Google Maps' Terrain View has the ability to consider elevation data along the path network. The Ordinance Survey's OSMaps gives users the ability to see terrain difficulty rankings for given pre-defined routes.

# DEMs

A key dataset a terrain-sensitive route planner must consider is elevation data. Steep inclines are much more difficult to traverse than

# GIS Software

The amount of data that can be represented on maps is immense. GIS is a category of technologies which attempts to organize this data, and allow for interesting data analysis. Data is categorized in layers representing data on the map such as "roads", "buildings", "rivers", but there may also be more complex sub-categories. Additionally, multiple data types (e.g. buildings and rivers) may be present in the same layer if required. These categories allow for efficient filtering for specific applications.
